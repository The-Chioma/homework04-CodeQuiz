# homework04-CodeQuiz

Using Javascript along with minimal HTML and Bootstrap classes, I have created a timed code quiz that lasts 100 seconds.
The quiz contains five simple programming questions. 
You get 10 points for a correct answer, however, if you click on a wrong answer, your time will be reduced by 10 seconds.
When the quiz is over, you will be requested to input your initials which will be stored in local storage, alongside your score.
You can view all highscores by clicking "View Highcores".
This quiz will store highscores of all players until the user clears the highscores by clicking the "Clear Highscores" button.
